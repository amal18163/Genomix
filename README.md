# Genomix

This interactive visualization was deployed as part of a study conducted by the Wellesley College HCI Lab to help non-expert users compare their personal genomic data with relatives. This demo features the genetic information of two siblings, Jessie and Jamie. Their genes are plotted onto a Venn diagram so as to highlight the similarities and differences between their genomes. Genes are color-coded to reflect their potential health effects (i.e. pathogenic vs. protective).

# Features
1) Filtering Genes:  
   Users can filter genes by category (i.e. blood, metabolism, cancer), health effect, and certainty of evidence.

2) Update Informational Sidebar on Click:  
   Click on a gene to learn more about it including its potential health effects, its rarity, how well the gene has been studied, and more.    The sidebar to the right of the screen will automatically update with the necessary info.

3) Saving Functionality (Front-End Response Only):  
   The full version deployed as part of the study allows logged-in users to save genes to their account. Because I worked exclusively on      developing the front-end of this visualization, this repo does not include the back-end code.
